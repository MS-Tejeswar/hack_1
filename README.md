The code for this problem statement works as follows:
1. It allows for a user to input e-waste item description which includes - Product name, type, condition, age and energy consumption
2. After inputting, It evaluates the product criterion and if it deems it in need to be recycled, it immediately asks for the address and mobile number so the product can be picked up by us and recycled properly. A day is assigned for the pickup
3. If it doesnt deem it in need to be recycled, it simply adds it to the DB of e-waste products
4. Finally, It allows us to see the pickup schedule
5. And also prepares a report of everything collected so far
